To work with this GUI project, you must have Turbo C++ installed on your 
computer.

1. Launch the Turbo C++ IDE by double-clicking on the project file. The project
   is called OATestGUI.bdsproj. (You can also just run the IDE and then open 
   the project file from there.)
   
2. You will have to add your ObjectAllocator files to the project for it to
   build properly. Do this by right-clicking on OATestGUI.exe in the project
   window (on the right) and choose "Add..." If you select ObjectAllocator.cpp,
   the IDE will automatically bring in ObjectAllocator.h as well.
   
3. Once you have added the .cpp file, press Shift-F9 to build the project. It 
   should build cleanly without warnings or errors.
   
4. To run the project, press F9. This runs it under the integrated debugger.
   To run without the debugger, press Ctrl-Shift-F9.
   
   If your hotkeys are not mapped to the default keys, you can use the menus
   and tool bars to perform the building and running of the project, just like
   any other IDE.
